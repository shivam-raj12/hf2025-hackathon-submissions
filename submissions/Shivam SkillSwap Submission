## Inspiration behind the Project  
As a hobby developer who isn’t pursuing any formal IT or computer science degree, I often faced challenges while learning online because most quality courses were too expensive. That’s when I thought — what if people could simply share what they know in exchange for learning something new? This idea inspired SkillSwap — a platform where people can trade their skills instead of paying for courses, making learning more accessible and collaborative for everyone.
